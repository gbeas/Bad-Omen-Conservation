# Bad Omen Conservation Club

## About

### The Project

In the state of Texas, the Parks and Wildlife Department maintain a program that offers land owners the support and incentives to engage in land management practices with the goal of wildlife management and conservation. These management efforts must be documented for a minimum  of 5 years to qualify for the available incentives.

With 23 acres just outside of the ever expanding DFW metroplex, the Bad Omen Conservation Club seeks to utilize this land to track, maintain, and protect native pollinator species and other protected birds and animals.

### The Name

About 10 years ago, a pair of black vultures took up residence under the deck of a small house on the property. Each year since, they have returned to roost and raise their chicks. While admittedly seen as a nuisance at first, the vultures have become a part of the landscape and welcome cohabitants. We now affectionately refer to original adult pair as Buzzballs and Bartholomew, Bartie for short. 

While many cultures in the western world view vultures as harbingers of death and decay, others revere them as deities and essential to natural order. As such, dead or alive, vultures will be interpreted by some as bad omens.

### The Repository

This repository is dedicated to the building and maintenance of tools to be used in the land management efforts laid out by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. As of today (August 8, 2024), this project is (obviously) empty. If you're here now, welcome to the beginning and I hope you'll stick around for the journey.
